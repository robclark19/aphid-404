#Data Collection Method

Every site was visited once every 3 weeks with 6 10m transects each visit.
Each transect:
1. Grass species along transect were identified and relative abundances were measured. 
2. Identification specimens were collected and brought to Marion Ownbey Herbarium. 
3. Insects were collected via sweep netting along transects. 
4. Samples were frozen and later insects were sorted out into ethanol from plant material.

#Vegetation dataset

Filename: raw_insect_vegetation_data_2021.csv

- sample_period = s1, s2, s3. Sites were visited in 3 week rotations called sampling periods. 
- date = date of transect
- site = 32 total sites each with distinctive name
- transect = each site visit had 6 transects at each visit except in rare circumstance where partially dead sites had fewer.
- aphid_prescence = yes or no based upon aphids collected in sweep netting
- gps = location for each transect taken from google maps pin
- distance = grass abundance recorded in 1m increments across the transect
Remaining columns are grass species positively identified. Values for relative abundance ranged up to 100 representing full coverage across the 1m increment.
